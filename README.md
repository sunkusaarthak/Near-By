# What is it. 
Nearby is an android application that helps you find things that are near you, it might be a restaurant or an ATM or anything else, as long as it is listed on the internet, nearby will help you find it. 

# Purpose
This application is a part of my 'experiments with android', as I was learning android development I wanted to check out the Google cloud Place API. So I built a basic application that helped me learn how to work withe APIs and integrate google cloud services with Android. 

# Implementation
## Tech Stack
    I have used the following technologies to build the application. 
    * Kotlin
    * XML
    * Google Cloud Place API. 
    * Fused Location Provider API. 
    
# How to use
If you intend to experiment with what I have done, feel free to download and run it on your android device. The code is also available feel free to use it too. You just need a little knowledge of how to work with APIs to start working on something similar or take my app ahead.
